Twice as long as a spear and even longer than a cavalryman's lance this is truly fearsome although rather unwieldy weapon. Due to this Pikemen never benefit from defended or fortified status when in dense terrain or on fortress walls etc. They still may be in defended position on higher ground or behind low obstacle as usual. Pikemen should be based as cavalry - i.e. the models are orientated towards the narrow edge of the base. Pikemen stands may only give or receive support by other infantry or Pikemen stands that are facing the same direction and touch their flank with the whole of their own flank. Any support behind or in front of Pikemen stand is not allowed. In all other respects they count as infantry (movement/pursuit etc.)."],"order":1},"Handgunners":{"text":["Handguns are rare but powerful weapons. A handgun shot can pierce armour far easier than an arrow or a crossbow bolt. Therefore, count enemy Armour values as one worse (-1) than normal."],"order":2},"Ogres":{"text":["Ogres flock to Dogs of War armies for the chance of a good fight and as much as they can eat. These creatures are notoriously fond of fresh human meat, although they will eat practically anything that was once alive (or still is). To represent this an Ogre unit must use its Initiative to charge an enemy unit of humans (humans&hellip; Men not Dwarfs, Elves etc.) if it is within 20cm at the start of the Command phase and the Ogres can reach it. This happens automatically."],"order":3},"Light Cavalry":{"text":["Dogs of War armies make great use of expert light cavalry from all around the world. Empire Pistoliers, Arabian Desert Riders, Hobgoblin Wolf Riders and Kislev Horse Archers are particularly adept at outmanoeuvring an enemy and harrying his flanks. Light cavalry are equipped with light bows or pistols and have a range of 15cm. However, as their weapons are so handy, they can shoot behind or to the side without turning stands to face their target. Just measure the range from any edge, front side or rear. They can therefore shoot at enemy charging them from any direction."],"order":4},"Galloper Guns":{"text":["These are lighter artillery than Dwarf or Empire cannons; due to this they are shorter ranged, but can make up for their lighter shot by producing a higher volume of fire.","","Galloper Guns move 20cm. All the normal rules for artillery applies as well as cannon's rules for shooting (bounce through, no saves and reduction of cover values). Because they are light guns they have a range of only 40cm. They still may shoot at the charging enemy by firing 'grapeshot' as normal."],"order":5},"Tuska":{"text":["These grey, elephantine or rhino-like monsters are indigenous to the hot jungles of the Southlands. Often Dogs of War generals manage to acquire trained beasts such as these from Arabian traders to use as shock troops in their armies. A driver known as a mahout sits astride the creature's neck and guides it into combat whilst bow-armed soldiers are housed in a small howdah upon its vast back. The creature itself is fearsome in combat, trampling soldiers and horses alike under foot and goring other creatures with its huge ivory tusks.","","A Tuska causes terror in its enemies. Because they are unruly creatures and difficult to control they may only ever be brigaded with other Tuskas. If you give an order to a Tuska and fail then you must make a test to see what it does. Ignore potential blunders as these are taken into consideration with the new table. Roll a dice and consult the 'Giant Goes Wild Chart' from the Orc army list and apply the results to the Tuska (with result no. 3 you can assume that the Tuska throws the rock with its trunk!). Where Tuskas are brigaded together, roll separately.","","__Giant Goes Wild Chart__","","|||","-|-","_D6_|_On no! What's he doing now!_","1|The Giant will neither move nor fight this turn but simply stands rooted to the spot looking dopey.","2|Move the Giant directly towards the nearest table edge. If he moves into another unit he will attack it regardless of which side it is on. If victorious in combat the Giant will hold his ground.","3|The Giant picks up a rock, tree, abandoned cart, outhouse or whatever comes to hand and throws it at the closest unit - friend or foe - that he can see. The object travels 5xD6cm and, if it travels far enough to hit its target, strikes with 3 Attacks worked out in the usual way.","4|The Giant moves straight forward at full pace in the direction he is facing in. If he reaches an enemy unit he will attack as normal. If he reaches a friendly unit he will walk straight through and out the other side if there is room and he has sufficient move. If he reaches a friendly unit and does not have sufficient move or enough room to walk all the way through then he halts on contact. A friendly unit that is walked through or contacted in this way instantly becomes confused for the remainder of the Command phase. Such a unit ceases to be confused at the end of the Command phase along with other confused units.","5|The Giant moves towards the nearest enemy unit that he can see as fast as he can. If he reaches the foe he will attack as normal. If friends are in the way he will walk through them causing confusion as described above.","6|The Giant gives a mighty bellow and rushes straight at the nearest enemy unit that he can see. Move the Giant at double his normal full pace move. If he reaches an enemy unit, he fights by jumping up and down on the foe, furiously doubling his Attack value in the first round of combat."],"order":6},"Birdmen":{"text":["Only half-mad nutters like Tileans would try to fly! The Birdmen wear insane contraptions of light wood covered in canvas that are shaped like wings and allow them to glide on the air currents. These 'wings' allow the Birdmen to fly and still use their crossbows as normal. Because they are awkward flyers, they can be pursued by any type of enemy troops. Birdmen are based facing the long edge of the base in the same way as other infantry."],"order":7},"Paymaster/Pay Wagon":{"text":["There may only ever be one Paymaster in the army. Only the Paymaster may use the Wagon. If the Pay Wagon is used the Paymaster may bribe the units around him to fight harder. He may add +1 to all of his Command checks for a single turn only."],"order":8},"Wizard":{"text":["The Wizard uses the Empire spells."],"order":9},"Griffon":{"text":["Generals, Wizards and Heroes may ride Griffons. The Griffon combines the appearance of a lion and an eagle. These creatures are hatched from stolen eggs and hand reared to serve as mounts for favoured individuals. The Griffon can fly, increasing the rider's movement to 100cm and it adds +2 Attacks to those of the rider. A unit which includes a Griffon causes terror in its enemies."],"order":10}},"spells":[{"roll":5,"range":"30cm","text":["A ball of flame shoots from the Wizard's outstretched arm burning all in its path. Draw an imaginary line 30cm long from the Wizard's stand in any direction you wish. The line will pass through any intervening units but not beyond terrain that would normally stop a missile shot, e.g. over the crest of a hill, more than 2cm of woodland, and so forth. Each unit under the line takes three shooting attacks worked out in the usual way. Note that this spell can easily affect several units and will affect all units that fall beneath the line (including your own). Unengaged units can be driven back by a Ball of Flame as with ordinary shooting (even including friends). Engaged units cannot be driven back by the Ball of Flame but carry over any hits scored into the first round of combat; any hits scored count as having been struck in the combat itself."],"name":"Ball of Flame"},{"roll":5,"range":"30cm","text":["The Wizard's voice booms out across the battlefield directing troops above the tumult of combat with the magical Voice of Command. The spell can be cast on any unengaged friendly unit within range regardless of whether the Wizard can see it or not. The spell affects only a single unit, never a brigade. The unit can be moved just as if it had received an order in the Command phase. Character stands that have joined the unit will not move with it: they remain where they are."],"name":"Voice of Command"},{"roll":4,"range":"30cm","text":["A weird enchantment forms around the target unit and engulfs it in strange lights, scary nightmares and disorientating special effects. This spell can be cast on any enemy unit within range regardless of whether the Wizard can see it or not. The spell lasts until the end of the opposing player's following turn. The unit moves at half pace in all situations: even when charging for example. The unit counts all enemies as terrifying (-1 Attack penalty). If the unit would normally cause terror then it ceases to do so and counts all enemies as terrifying just like everyone else. However, if the target is Undead or Daemonic unit it will not count enemies as terrifying although all other penalties apply as described (Undead and Daemons are hard to spook)."],"name":"Weird Enchantment"},{"roll":2,"text":["With a swirl of his cloak, a crack of thunder and just a hint of maniacal laughter the Wizard vanishes to reappear anywhere on the battlefield. The Wizard is moved to a new position anywhere on the table. He can leave or join a unit if he wishes, enabling a Wizard to move into or out of combat for example. Once the Wizard has moved he can cast a second spell, but note this must be a different spell and not a further Teleport! Roll to cast the second spell as normal. A Wizard that Teleports successfully can therefore potentially cast two spells that turn."],"name":"Teleport"}]}
