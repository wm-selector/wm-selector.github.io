In a samurai heavy army samurai units disregard any non samurai losses. Monk armies are equally unperturbed by the loss of unholy or secular mercenaries. As a result of this the break point of a Nippon army is 50% rounded up of the total number of either","","* The Samurai units or","","* Monks and Temple units - (temple dogs, imps and oni)","","whichever is the higher.","","Armies with more Monks are deemed to be led by an Abbot - those with more Samurai are led by a Secular Lord or Daimyo. Ronin, Ashigaru, and Tengu do not count toward break points regardless of the army composition. If at the start of the game the number of Monks and Temple units is the same as the number of Samurai units - then the Nippon player nominates which one will be his BP units by specifying if an Abbot or Daimyo is the General of the army."],"specialRules":{"Expert Swordsmen":{"order":1,"text":["The unit gets +1 attack per stand for the initial combat round in any Combat phase - this applies to defence or attack - it is not a charge bonus. It does not apply to the initial attack after an advance move or any pursuit moves."]},"Honour Bound":{"order":2,"text":["The troops do not like losing face thus:they cannot use initiative to evade; always take 1 less drive back dice from shooting; must pursue if winning the combat. However, they are not compelled to advance after winning a combat nor pursue if they were fortified."]},"Stoic":{"order":3,"text":["Warrior monks are partially monks with samurai armour under their robes and partially samurai with monk robes over their armour! The anonymity of the Orders' robes removes any honour bound effect. Monks are just as stoic as samurai so have -1 drive back dice, and due to their more arduous training they do not suffer the command penalty for proximity to enemy."]},"Zealots":{"order":4,"text":["Basically your Fanatics' Fanatic. Same rules as Flagellants - no drive back, immune to terror - must use initiative to charge enemy if possible. Additionally, if shot at these troops roll for a drive forward - they move 1D6cm per hit directly toward the nearest enemy unit that shot at it. If this movement brings them into contact then it counts as a charge in the same way as the advance into fresh enemy."]},"Shrine":{"order":5,"text":["The Shrine may be attached to any Monk unit as a Skirmish stand. Unit so equipped ignores terror, and can attempt to dispel any magic cast within or targeted within 60cm of the Shrine on a 4+, only one attempt per spell cast may be made - similar to a Runesmith. The Shrine is lost when the 'skirmishing' stand carrying it is removed."]},"Assorted Weapons":{"order":6,"text":["Unit with such weapon may shoot in a range of 15cm from the front edge only."]},"Tengu":{"order":7,"text":["Tengu are wood daemons - half bird half man, also known as expert fighters. May see up to 4cm in woods and may make a magical move from wood to wood in a range up to 40cm by a successful order. This movement is treated as a sort of flight or teleport - Tengu unit diappears in one wood, appears in next, and may charge the enemy that was visible for any one Tengu stand in a start of this move as normal. All Tengu stands must be wholly or partially in a wood when starting and finishing this movement."]},"Dragonne":{"order":8,"text":["Being a cross (don't ask!) between a dragon and a lion the Dragonne causes terror. A weak flyer - max 60cm. Dragonnes have a deafening roar that can be used as a shooting attack of 20cm range when attached to a unit - no armour save is made for this attack."]},"Retinue":{"order":9,"text":["For every 1000pts a Daimyo or Hatamoto character can gain household retinue, this is treated as a special mount to limit its accumulation to one per character.

Only a single example of each type of retinue can be included in an army. The retinue options are:","","* __Vim'to Monk__ - Gives the character a +1CV (max 10) to his first command test each turn.","","* __Ninja Warriors__ - The character stand has hired ninjas and may displace an enemy character in the same way a unit does, i.e. when moved over. Additionally the stand has +1 attacks and +1 shooting to the stat line of the character when in a unit. Character with Ninja Warriors can have runesmith magic items.","","* __Sorcerer__ knows 1 spell from the Nippon Spell List that he may cast once per Nippon magic phase as usual. Character cannot take a Sorcerer Retinue if a shrine is included in an army. Character's command range is unaffected. Character with Sorcerer retinue can have wizarding magic items.","","* __Guards__ +2 attacks.","","* __Mystic__ - A character with a mystic in his pay may roll 2D6 at the start of each initiative phase - The score is kept and the character may allocate that command to any brigade at any time in the Command phase as his first command. The mystic has seen the future and guides the commander! Mystics can have runesmith magic items.","","It should be made clear by the models on the base what advisor, if any, is present. And of course you can't ride a Dragonne when you are assisted by the retinue.
