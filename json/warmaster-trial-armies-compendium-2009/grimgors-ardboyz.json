Effigy is a terrain-piece-alike marker that may be placed anywhere in 'Ardboyz' deployment zone before the battle and can not be moved further. Once per Command phase any one Orc character that is in range up to 50cm from the Effigy can issue his first order against an unmodified Command value of 10. So no any penalties or other bonuses apply when the Effigy's bonus is used. The Effigy's bonus only applies to the character's first order this turn, subsequent orders must be given normally. Should the character fail to issue his first order, by rolling an 11 or 12, then the Effigy of Gork ceases to work till the end of battle."],"order":7},"Grimgor":{"text":["The General may be upgraded to a Grimgor himself. In this case the single unit of Da Immortulz is allowed when picking the army. Grimgor can not join other units than Da Immortulz. Grimgor can not take any magic items.

You must declare the using of this ability before the roll is made."],"order":8},"Da Immortulz":{"text":["Being Black Orcs, the unit of Da Immortulz doesn't count for determining the min/max number of Black Orcs in your army. The unit of Da Immortulz can not take any magic items or magic banners. Grimgor can join and leave Da Immortulz as usual, but can't join other units. Other characters can't join Da Immortulz.
