The total number of woods on his half of a table including already placed woods must not exceed 2 per every 1000 points of his army cost. If the number of already placed woods exceeds this value, the Wood Elf player may not place additional woods (when counting this number please disregard small wooded terrain pieces which could be covered fully by a rectangle 10x15cm). The size of any single additional wood piece may vary from 10x20cm up to 15x20cm. Each wood piece must be placed 12cm from any other dense terrain piece (including other woods) - this exactly means the woods can not be joined together as well as with other pieces of dense terrain."],"specialRules":{"Woodland Folk":{"text":["Due to living amongst the forests of Loren their entire lives, all Wood Elf infantry does not suffer the usual -1 Command penalty when within woodland."],"order":1},"Glade Guard/Waywatchers/Glade Riders":{"text":["Wood Elves are just as famed for their bow skills as their High Elf cousins, and as such these elven units add +1 to their dice roll when making shooting attacks.

Any '6's rolled to hit when shooting ignore armour."],"order":4},"Dryads":{"text":["Dryads are flammable.

They will never use their initiative to evade. Wild Riders are unaffected by enemy that cause terror in combat, so they don't suffer the usual -1 Attack modifier. In addition, if the unit is charging against an enemy in the open it receives an additional +1 Attack modifier in the same way as chariots and monsters."],"order":6},"Warhawk Riders":{"text":["Warhawk riders can fly. They have a shooting range of only 15cm. However, they can shoot from any edge without turning stands to face their target. Just measure the range from any stand edge, front, side or rear.

The Treeman may neither take any magic items nor be mounted on any mounts. Treeman may may add +1 to his command value when issuing orders to Dryads units (but not to brigades that include units other than Dryads). Not being a real wizard the Treeman still may cast Tree Singing spell once per magic phase, but being a hero the Treeman has a command range of 60cm as usual."],"order":8},"Giant Stag":{"text":["General, Nobles and Spell Weavers may ride a Giant Stag.

Unlike other Dragons, they are herbivores, using their rows of saw-like teeth to rip up branches, logs and any other vegetation they feel like eating. However, they are similar to other Dragons in that they are intelligent and also immensely powerful creatures, capable of uprooting trees and tossing them about in a scarily casual manner when enraged. An exceptional Wood Elf Lord or Mage may succeed in winning the trust of one of these immense creatures, and in doing so will have secured himself a fearsome mount to ride into battle","","Generals, Nobles and Spell Weavers may ride Forest Dragons. A Forest Dragon can fly, increasing its rider's move to 100cm, and adds +3 Attacks to those of its rider. Any unit joined by a character riding a Forest Dragon cause terror in their enemies and so long as the Dragon is attached to a unit, it can use its Corrosive Breath attack. This is a shooting attack with a range of 20cm, which can be directed against one target as normal. The breath has 3 Attacks, which are worked out in the usual way."],"order":12}},"spells":[{"roll":4,"range":"30cm","text":["This spell moves one wooded terrain piece along with unengaged friendly units inside up to D6 cm in any direction leaving in place all enemy stands that initially were in this wood.
