In addition, the Wolf Riders that ride in this army can, if defeated in combat, elect to break off and run for the hills (or at least out of harm's way!). Wolf Riders can only break off after the first round of combat has been fought!","","To do this, roll 5D6 and add the scores together. This is the Wolf Riders' fall back move. You may then move the Wolf Riders straight back by this distance facing away from their attackers. If any 6s are rolled, the Wolf Riders are also confused. The attacking player counts as having destroyed his enemy, so is allowed to advance (up to 20cm if in the first round of combat, 10cm if in subsequent rounds).","","If fighting with cavalry, you may also elect to pursue the Wolf Riders. To do this, roll 5D6 and add the scores together. If this distance is sufficient to bring them into contact with the Wolf Riders then units from both sides are moved and combat is fought. The Wolf Riders will suffer -1 Attack for being attacked in the rear."],"order":3},"Spider Riders":{"text":["Spider Riders can move through wooded areas as though they were infantry. They also do not receive any penalty for being in wooded terrain when receiving orders.

Note that this spell can easily affect several units and will affect all units that fall beneath the line (including your own).

This is treated in the same way as a drive back from shooting, except that the direction is established by determining the shortest route to the table edge.
