One of these units may be Savage Orс Boar Boyz (see below)."]},"Savage Orс Boar Boyz":{"order":2,"text":["These receive +1 to their attack value (as per Power of the Waaagh) if they charge an enemy. This +1 lasts for the entire combat, whilst they are winning. They do not receive this bonus if they themselves are charged or if they lose a round of combat."]},"Wolf Riders":{"order":3,"text":["Wolf Riders follow the rules in the Orс army list. In addition, the Wolf Riders that ride in this army can, if defeated in combat, elect to break off and run for the hills (or at least out of harm's way!). Wolf Riders can only break off after the first round of combat has been fought!","","To do this, roll 5D6 and add the scores together. This is the Wolf Riders' fall back move. You may then move the Wolf Riders straight back by this distance facing away from their attackers. If any 6s are rolled, the Wolf Riders are also confused. The attacking player counts as having destroyed his enemy, so is allowed to advance (up to 20cm if in the first round of combat, 10cm if in subsequent rounds).","","If fighting with cavalry, you may also elect to pursue the Wolf Riders. To do this, roll 5D6 and add the scores together. If this distance is sufficient to bring them into contact with the Wolf Riders then units from both sides are moved and combat is fought. The Wolf Riders will suffer -1 Attack for being attacked in the rear."]},"Spider Riders":{"order":4,"text":["Spider Riders can move through wooded areas as though they were infantry. They also do not receive any penalty for being in wooded terrain when receiving orders. Spider Riders can shoot up to 15cm from any edge, no matter front, side or rear."]},"Squig Hoppers":{"order":5,"text":["Squig Hoppers, or a brigade containg Squig Hoppers, suffer a -1 penalty when receiving orders due to the rowdy and unpredictable nature of the Squigs. Squig Hoppers must charge any enemy target within 20cm during the initiative phase regardless of direction! Also Squig Hoppers become confused on a D6 roll of 5 or 6, rather than the normal 6."]},"Giant":{"order":6},"Wyvern":{"order":7,"text":["Generals, Wizards and Heroes can ride Wyverns.

The line will pass through any intervening units but not beyond terrain that would normally stop a missile shot, eg over the crest of a hill, more than 2cm of woodland, and so forth.","","Each unit under the line takes three shooting attacks worked out in the usual way. Note that this spell can easily affect several units and will affect all units that fall beneath the line (including your own). Unengaged units can be driven back by a Gotcha as with ordinary shooting (even including friends). Engaged units cannot be driven back by the Gotcha but carry over any hits scored into the first round of combat; any hits scored count as having been struck in the combat itself."]},{"name":"Gerroff!!!","roll":5,"range":"60cm","text":["The voice of Gork booms out across the battlefield driving back his foes with a rancid gale force yell.","","This spell can be cast on any unengaged enemy unit within range regardless of whether the Shaman can see it or not. The spell cannot be cast on a unit engaged in combat.","","The enemy unit is driven back 5 x D6cm towards its own table edge. This is treated in the same way as a drive back from shooting, except that the direction is established by determining the shortest route to the table edge. A unit cannot be routed by a drive back from a Gerroff spell. If the unit leaves the table edge it must roll as described in the main Warmaster rules (See Movement p19-23)."]},{"name":"Waaagh!","roll":5,"range":"30cm","text":["The shaman summons the power of the mighty Waaagh! to invigorate the greenskins.","","This spell can be cast on a friendly unit of Orc or Goblins engaged in combat; including Black Orcs, Wolf Riders, Boar Boyz and any type of Orc or Goblin troops but not Trolls, Ogres, Giants or other non-greenskins. The spell can be cast regardless of whether the Shaman can see the target or not.","","The spell lasts for the duration of the following Combat phase.","","Every stand in the unit, including characters that have joined the unit, adds +1 to its Attack value."]}]}
