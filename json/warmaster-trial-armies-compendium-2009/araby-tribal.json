This doesn't apply to brigades that include Tribal troops and other units. Tribal foot troops have an extra -1 command penalty when in dense terrain. Remember that characters cannot issue orders to units beyond their maximum command range."],"order":1},"Scorpion Warriors":{"text":["Scorpion Warriors are trained bands of warriors who use all and every means of killing. Enemy must re-roll any passed armour saves from hits caused by Scorpion Warriors. They may not have a Dervish stand added to them as they make too much noise. Scorpion Warriors count as fortified in dense terrain even though they suffer the additional -1 command that all tribal units have when in dense terrain."],"order":2},"Dervishers":{"text":["Dervishers can be added to any infantry or cavalry unit except Scorpion Warriors as a skirmishing infantry stand. Whilst they are with the unit their frenzy encourages the rest of the unit so that it does not suffer from drive backs. If taken as casualties the loss of a Dervish stand does not cause a -1 command penalty. The unit can only move at the speed of the slowest stand. A Dervish stand (but not the unit it is with) never gets Attack modifiers for enemy facing its side or rear or for fighting the terrifying enemy."],"order":3},"Desert Raiders":{"text":["They are so fast that if they win or draw a combat then they are able to fall back up to 4D6cm instead of 3D6. Light Horses that lost the first round of their combat may still fall back 2D6 (instead of retreating). This move is allowed unless it requires friends to make way for them - in that case they retreat as normal. After Light Horses fled, the pursuing enemy may advance as normal unless he has other units to pursue in that combat engagement or had already advanced that turn. The advance is made as usual to the closest visible enemy which may in fact be the escaping horsemen."],"order":4},"Tuareg Camels":{"text":["Camels are based facing the long edge of the base in the same way as infantry."],"order":5},"Ruhk":{"text":["A Ruhk is a huge monster big enough for a crew - it is based on 40x40mm stand and can shoot in a range up to 30cm. A Ruhk can fly and causes terror."],"order":6},"Mullah":{"text":["Mullahs have a 4+ dispel ability as per Runesmiths. Only one Mullah may attempt to dispel each spell. Mullahs may not take any magic items other than dispel scrolls but each mullah can have 1 scroll."],"order":7},"Flying Carpets":{"text":["Flying Carpets are special mounts and can fly. Carpets are covered with powerful glyphs that enhance a Mullahs dispel ability once per game by +1 if the carpet is the Mullah's mount."],"order":8},"Sand Lizards":{"text":["Sand Lizard causes terror in its enemies."],"order":9},"Scroll of Dispelling":{"text":["If a Mullah has the Scroll of Dispelling he can automatically cause an enemy's spell to fail. The Scroll can only be used once to nullify the effect of a spell an enemy Wizard has successfully cast. The Scroll can be used after a normal anti-magic roll has failed."],"order":10}}}
