If a Runesmith stand includes the Anvil, once per battle he can add +1 to his dice roll when he attempts to dispel enemy magic spells using the Dwarf anti-magic ability (see Runesmith). In addition the Runesmith can strike the Anvil during the Shooting phase of his own turn. The Anvil's plangent rune-song fills the Dwarfs with even greater resolve! Roll a D6. On the score of a 4, 5 or 6 all Dwarf units within 20cm of the Runesmith are unaffected by Terror till the start of the next Dwarf player's turn. On a roll of less than 4 there is no effect."],"order":8},"Airship":{"text":["The Dwarf Airship is used as an observation balloon. All artillery within 10cm of the balloon, or shooting a target within 10cm of the balloon, adds one to hit when shooting, so will normally hit on a 3 instead of a 4 and so on. The airship is treated the same as other flyers but has no Attacks and as such cannot be attacked. This represents the fact that the airship is flying at a high altitude. The airship is classed as a chariot mount and a hero or Runesmith must be placed in it (this means that if you field the airship, you lose a hero!). The use of the airship is more that it is a cracking model! You may field only one airship, no matter how large your army is&hellip;"],"order":9}}}
