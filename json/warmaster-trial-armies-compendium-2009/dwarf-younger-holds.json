To represent this you can only take up to 150 points of Artillery and Machines per 1000 points in the army, but in any combination of the 3 relevant units."]},"Throwing Weapons":{"order":"S","text":["Throwing Weapons. Some units from Younger Holds are assumed to use short distance shooting and throwing weapons, explosives etc. As such they are able to shoot at chargers in a standard way. Additionally they may count +1 attack per unit on the first round of combat when charging. Please note that the range of the throwing attacks is always 0cm and they can be executed only when in contact with the enemy."]},"Handgunners":{"order":1,"text":["A handgun shot can pierce armour far more easily than an arrow or a crossbow bolt. Therefore, count enemy Armour values as one worse than normal when shot by a handgun. So an armour value of 3+ counts as 4+, 4+ as 5+, and 5+ as 6+, whilst an Armour value of 6+ can't save against a handgun."]},"Rangers":{"order":2,"text":["Although they are infantry the exceptional mobility of Dwarf Rangers means that they can pursue any type of retreating enemy."]},"Troll Slayers":{"order":3,"text":["(What we considered is giving the Troll Slayers an extended move, representing their eagerness to get stuck in and giving the Dwarfs the equivalent of cavalryâ€¦ Very suicidal ones at that.)","","1. During the 'home back' part of the Movement phase, Troll Slayers must move 10cm towards the nearest enemy in sight. No formation changes may be made during this move, unless they come into contact with the enemy and in result count as charging. If there is no enemy in sight this additional move is not allowed.","","2. Troll Slayers must charge on initiative if enemy is within 20cm and this is determined after their mandatory move. Troll Slayers may not evade.","","In both of the above cases Troll Slayers may have line of sight on a unit, but be partly blocked by intervening friendly units. Simply move directly ahead with all stands and roll D6 for each unit in front of them, confusing them on a roll of 5, 6 (must be very confusing to have all the maniacs push though your ranks to get to the foe).","","Troll Slayers cannot be driven back by shooting and never roll for drive backs. Troll Slayers must pursue or advance if victorious in combat where they are permitted to do so.","","Troll Slayers are unaffected by enemy that cause terror in combat and they don't suffer the -1 Attack modifier.","","Troll Slayers positively enjoy fighting monsters - the bigger the better in fact! Slayers get +1 Attack per stand when fighting against a Monster or Troll unit.","","Troll Slayer units earn victory points differently to other units as follows:","","1. If a Troll Slayer unit has any stands remaining at the end of the battle then the full points value of the unit is awarded to the opposing side as victory points. It doesn't matter if the unit has 3, 2 or 1 stand remaining - if there are any stands left at all the enemy gets the full victory points.","","2. If a Troll Slayer unit is destroyed then the half of its victory points are scored for the opponent.","","Slayer units that have been destroyed do not count towards the Dwarf army's losses for purposes of calculating withdrawal."]},"Miners":{"order":4,"text":["A unit of these never suffers command distance penalties. They may be deployed normally at the start of the game either in the deployment zone or anywhere on the table but at least 40cm away from any enemy unit. Alternatively they can also be kept in reserve and placed during the Dwarven Command phase on a successful order, with the same 40cm distance restriction. When placed from reserve the unit can not receive further orders that turn. As long as the unit stays on its deployment position it is considered to be defended."]},"Flame Cannon":{"order":5},"Dragon Slayer":{"order":6,"text":["Dragon Slayer causes terror, so the unit which is joined by a Slayer character is considered to cause terror.","","Dragon Slayers may not retreat up to 30cm when moved through by an enemy unit. Instead any Dragon Slayer character captured for any reason by an enemy unit will seek their doom and attempt to die honourably in battle. As such the Dragon Slayer executes a number of attacks equal to his Attack value +D3 on the capturing unit. The effect of this will be applied immediately, and does not carry over. Should these attacks effectively kill the capturing unit then the Dragon Slayer character stays alive and remains in the game."]},"Runesmith":{"order":7,"text":["Although they are not wizards and cannot therefore cast spells, Dwarf Runesmiths can combat the magic of their enemies. If an enemy Wizard who is within 50cm of the Runesmith casts a spell the Runesmith can attempt to 'anti-magic' it. Note that it does not matter what the spell is or where it is cast, the Runesmith can 'anti-magic' it so long as the caster is within 50cm. To determine if this works roll a D6 - on the score of 4, 5 or 6 the Runesmith has succeeded and the spell doesn't work, it is dispelled by the Runesmith's defiant efforts. If he fails then the Runesmith's efforts come to nothing and the spell works as normal. A Runesmith can attempt to anti-magic any number of spells in a turn, but only one attempt can be made to anti-magic any individual spell - even if the army includes more than one Runesmith and several are in range of the enemy Wizard."]},"Anvil":{"order":8,"text":["*Alternative Rules.* The army can only include a single Anvil and it is incorporated onto the stand of a Runesmith.","","If a Runesmith stand includes the Anvil, he can strike the Anvil during the Shooting phase of his own turn. The Anvil's plangent rune-song fills the Dwarfs with even greater resolve!","","Choose one from the following effects:","","1. Anti-terror. On a successful roll all Dwarf units within 20cm of the Runesmith are unaffected by terror till the start of the next Dwarf player's turn.","","2. Extended dispel range. The Runesmith has an effective dispel range of 80cm till the start of the next Dwarf player's turn.","","3. Boosted dispel power. The Runesmith can opt to add +1 to one dispel roll. Mind you that the Anvil now is no longer restricted to the once-per-game bonus on dispel, but starts being \"loaded\" with that one, which is replaced with one of the above effects on a successful cast. Roll a D6. On the score of a 4, 5 or 6 the effect chosen above becomes active and replaces any current effect. On a roll of less than 4 Anvil has no effect.","","Instead of striking the Anvil, the Dwarf player can opt to Ground the Anvil. This should be seen as a last resolve option but provides for a interesting end-game. When the Runesmith decides to Ground the Anvil he actually fuses the Anvil to the underground, sending currents of power through the neighbouring area. This is done in the Shooting phase, similar to Striking the Anvil. Grounding the Anvil is automatic and allows the Runesmith to select one of the Striking the Anvil conditions, without the need to roll for them, which will last till the end of the game. Grounding the Anvil also grants the Dwarven army a resolve bonus; for the rest of the game Dwarven troops ignore the Command modifier for being under strength. The downside on this is that it turns the Anvil into a 1 stand unit (normal Dwarf Warrior statistics) which is joined by the Runesmith and which he can not leave. This Anvil Stand cannot be moved by any means or effects in the game, but has gained \"objective\" status and its destruction is a game-end condition!","","__Anvil.__ *Standard Rules.* The army can only include a single Anvil and it is incorporated onto the stand of a Runesmith. If a Runesmith stand includes the Anvil, once per battle he can add +1 to his dice roll when he attempts to dispel enemy magic spells using the Dwarf anti-magic ability (see Runesmith). In addition the Runesmith can strike the Anvil during the Shooting phase of his own turn. The Anvil's plangent rune-song fills the Dwarfs with even greater resolve! Roll a D6. On the score of a 4, 5 or 6 all Dwarf units within 20cm of the Runesmith are unaffected by terror till the start of the next Dwarf player's turn. On a roll of less than 4 Anvil has no effect."]},"Cannon":{"order":9},"Gyrocopter":{"order":10}}}
