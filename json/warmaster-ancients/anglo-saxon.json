Whilst not he luckiest of men, Harold did a fine job of moving his army from the north, where he fought and defeated a Scandinavian invasion, to the south, where things famously turned out less well. In recognition of his achievement, Harold, and all other Saxon Commanders within 20cm of Harold, have a Command value of 10 in the first turn of the game. Sadly, this bonus only applies in the first turn&mdash;so make the move of it while the going is good!"],"order":5}}}
