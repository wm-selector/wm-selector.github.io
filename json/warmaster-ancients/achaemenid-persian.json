As the Persians advanced through Greece, many cities swore fealty to the Persians rather than be destroyed, whilst still others wavered even in the heat of battle itself. Before the game, the Persian player rolls a D6 and deducts 2 down to a minimum score of 1. This indicates the number of enemy units that are affected (between 1 and 4). These units are considered to be Unreliable until such time as one core Persian unit has been destroyed. The opposing player chooses which of his own units are affected&mdash;these must be units that are not normally Unreliable."]},"Immortals":{"order":5,"text":["Upgrade one unit of Persian infantry to Immortals with the stats shown.
