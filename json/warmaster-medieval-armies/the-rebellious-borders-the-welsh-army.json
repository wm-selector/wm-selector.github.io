In the opposing player's turn, in his Command phase, Llywelyn can spring an 'ambush' after any successful Command roll made by the enemy General. The opposing player can't make any more Command rolls that turn after the ambush has been spring - even if the opposing General would otherwise be entitled to re-rolls. The Ambush rule can only be used once in the game."]}}}
