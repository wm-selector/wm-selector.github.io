Because it is such a specific thing, and quite involved, we have put this rule here rather than in the general Special Rules section.","","**1.** A Ballast Wagon unit looks exactly like any other War Wagon unit. However, the player must either make a note or mark under the Wagon's base in some way to indicate that the unit comprises Ballast Wagons.","","**2.** The unit fights exactly like other war Wagons. In addition the player can cut the wagons loose and roll them towards the enemy - this requires a separate order to be successfully issued to the Ballast Wagons in the Command phase.","","**3.** If successful, the unit is formed into a line (narrow edge to the front) and aimed at a visible enemy target within 30cm and within the frontal arc of the unit (as standard for missile targets). The player then rolls 5d6 and adds the scores together - this is the total distance the Wagon unit ttravels before the Wagons tip over and destroyed. The Wagons will roll through any units in their wau, striking each in turn. Any unit hit by the runaway Wagons suffers 6 attacks with no saving throws allowed for any hits caused. Enemy units treat any hits suffered as missile hits in the Shooting Phase and must roll for drive backs accordingly.","","**4.** Once employed in this fashion, the Ballast Wagon unit is destroyed and all three stands representing it are removed casualties.","","**Comment.** Note that we allow to roll from flat ground and make the assumption that no ground is really flat and a gentle slope may be involved. If wagon stands attempt to roll uphill or if they hit woods, a river, or any terrain normally impassable to wagons, they are wrecked without further effect. In any case, once employed in this fashion, the Ballast Wagon unit is destroyed and all three stands representing it are removed."]},"Terror":{"order":7}}}
