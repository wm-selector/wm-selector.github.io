To represent this, the Bretonnian army calculates when it must withdraw from the battle in a different way to other armies. Instead of counting all of its units at the start of the game, count only the number of units of Knights and Grail Knights. Once the army has lost a half or more of its units of Knights/Grail Knights it must withdraw."],"specialRules":{"Peasants":{"text":["A unit of peasants suffers an additional -1 Command penalty when given an order. However, this penalty is waived if the peasant unit is part of a brigade that includes at least one non-peasant unit. Peasants cannot use initiative to charge - though they can use initiative to evade as usual. When they charge they receive no bonus attack modifier for doing so."],"order":1},"Knights":{"text":["A Knight unit will always use its initiative to charge an enemy if possible and cannot be given orders instead. They will never use their initiative to evade. Knights are unaffected by enemy that cause terror in combat, they don't suffer the usual -1 Attack modifier."],"order":2},"Grail Knights":{"text":["All the rules described for Knights also apply to Grail Knights. In addition, if the unit is charging against an enemy in the open it receives an additional +1 Attack modifier in the same way as chariots and monsters."],"order":3},"Trebuchet":{"text":["The model must be mounted onto a base 40mm frontage and 60mm depth - note that this is equivalent to three standard sized Warmaster bases glued together.","","The trebuchet has a range of 100cm. It hurls a rock with such a high trajectory that it cannot shoot at a charging target or at any target stand within 30cm range. No armour roll is made when shot at by a trebuchet.","","The trebuchet can shoot at targets that it can see as for all other artillery, and it can shoot over the heads of obstacles and friends on lower ground just as can other artillery. In addition it can 'shoot blind' - which is to say it can shoot at a target that it cannot see. This blind shooting is directed by observers who form part of the trebuchet's operational team, but who are not directly represented on the tabletop. When shooting blind roll an initial D6 to test if the shot is on target - a score of a 6 indicates that this is so, a score of less than 6 means the shot has gone so wild that no further account is made of it. If the shot is deemed to be on target, roll to score hits as you normally would.","","Like all artillery it must shoot at the nearest target. Targets under 30cm away are ignored for this purpose - it cannot shoot at them anyway.","","The Trebuchet is so large and heavy that it cannot move. It is deployed on the table at the start of the game and remains static thereafter. It cannot move of its own volition or otherwise.","","If obliged to move as a result of a drive back caused by normal shooting or magic drive back dice are rolled as normal. If a 6 is rolled it is considered destroyed. The crew have run off. All other dice rolls are ignored and the Trebuchet can carry on as normal.","","If obliged to move off table by a Gerroff spell then roll 1 X D6. If a 6 is rolled it is destroyed. All other dice rolls are ignored.","","Note that you can only have 1 trebuchet in your army no matter how many points you are playing (just like a general). Also, the Trebuchet is is not counted towards the army's units for purposes of withdrawal - it is not a unit of Knights or Grail Knights!"],"order":4},"Pegasus":{"text":["The pegasus can be ridden by a general, hero or Enchantress and adds +1 Attack to the rider as well as allowing the character to fly. "],"order":5},"Unicorn":{"text":["Only an Enchantress can ride a unicorn. The unicorn adds +1 to the Enchantress's Attacks. Once per battle the unicorn's magical power adds +1 to the dice when casting a spell. The player must announce that he is using the unicorn's magic before rolling to see if the spell works."],"order":6}},"spells":[{"roll":4,"range":"15cm","text":["The enemy's missiles sparkle in the sunlight and vanish magically in mid-air causing no harm to their target.","","The spell is cast upon the Enchantress herself and affects all friendly units within 15cm of the stand.","","The spell lasts until the end of the opposing player's following turn.","","All friendly units within 15cm of the Enchantress can re-roll any failed Armour rolls during the Shooting phase. This applies to all Armour rolls whether from ordinary missile fire, dragon breath, spells, and so forth.","","The re-roll also applies to Armour rolls taken for hits that have been suffered whilst charging at an enemy unit that shoots prior to contact. In this case the re-roll only applies if the Enchantress is within 15cm of the unit at the start of its charge move: it does not matter if the Enchantress is more distant once the unit has completed its charge.","","Note that only a single re-roll is permitted regardless of how many Enchantresses are within range or what other factors apply.

This does not include hits suffered from enemy missile- fire during a charge, as these are deemed to be shooting hits and are encompassed by the Aerial Shield spell.","","Note that only a single re-roll is permitted regardless of what other factors apply.
