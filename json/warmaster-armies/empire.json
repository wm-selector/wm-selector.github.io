They'll never use their initiative to evade. They can't be driven back by shooting and do not roll for drive backs. If a unit of flagellants is victorious in combat and is able to pursue the enemy or advance in accordance with the rules, then it must to do so where possible. Flagellants are unaffected by enemies that cause terror in combat, so they do not suffer the usual -1 Attack modifier."],"order":2},"Skirmishers":{"text":["Skirmisher stands never count as independent units under any circumstances. Instead, you may add one stand of Skirmishers to any of your infantry units. This brings the size of the unit to 4 stands - i.e. 3 ordinary stands plus the skirmisher. Skirmishers always have the same Armour value as the rest of their unit, either 6+ or 0. They fight as part of their unit and can be removed as a unit casualty if the player wishes. Skirmisher casualties never count as casualties for purposes of issuing orders, which means there is no -1 Command penalty as there normally would be for units that have lost a stand. Skirmisher stands never count as part of the unit's formation when determining whether they move at full or half pace, so no movement penalty is incurred if they are arranged out of the unit's regular formation. As a result skirmishers are both more adaptable and more expendable than other troops."],"order":3},"Pistoliers":{"text":["Pistoliers have a shooting range of only 15cm, however they can shoot all round - i.e. behind or to the side as well as to their front.

The Griffon can fly increasing its rider's Movement from 60cm to 100cm. It adds +2 Attacks to those of its rider.

Consequently an army, no matter how large, can only ever include one. A War Altar can only be included as a mount for a Wizard, in which case he is assumed to be the Grand Theogonist. The presence of the War Altar adds +1 Attack and enables the Grand Theogonist to add +1 to the dice when casting a spell once during the battle.

Note that this spell can easily affect several units and will affect all units that fall beneath the line (including your own). Unengaged units can be driven back by a Ball of Flame as with ordinary shooting (even including friends). Engaged units cannot be driven back by the Ball of Flame but carry over any hits scored into the first round of combat; any hits scored count as having been struck in the combat itself."],"name":"Ball of Flame"},{"roll":5,"range":"30cm","text":["The Wizard's voice booms out across the battlefield directing troops above the tumult of combat with the magical Voice of Command.","","The spell can be cast on any unengaged friendly unit within range regardless of whether the Wizard can see it or not.

The unit counts all enemies as terrifying (-1 Attack penalty). If the unit would normally cause terror then it ceases to do so and counts all enemies as terrifying just like everyone else. However, if the target is Undead or Daemonic unit it will not count enemies as terrifying although all other penalties apply as described (Undead and Daemons are hard to spook)."],"name":"Weird Enchantment"},{"roll":2,"text":["With a swirl of his cloak, a crack of thunder and just a hint of maniacal laughter the Wizard vanishes to reappear anywhere on the battlefield.","","The Wizard is moved to a new position anywhere on the table. He can leave or join a unit if he wishes, enabling a Wizard to move into or out of combat for example. Once the Wizard has moved he can cast a second spell, but note this must be a different spell and not a further Teleport! Roll to cast the second spell as normal.
