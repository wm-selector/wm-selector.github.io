cavalry units were mounted on camels rather than horses. This was usually a matter of convenience or necessity rather than preference. Camels have a useful characteristic that the ancients recognized and often exploited: namely. horses don\'t like \'em! It\'s the smell.","","1. If an army does not include camel units then its horses find the scent of camels unsettling. Consequently, if a unit of horsed cavalry or chariots is within 20cm of enemy camels when an order is given, any failure, regardless of the dice roll, is considered to be a Blunder (see p68). Even if the order is given by the General, a failure counts as a blunder in this situation. This penalty applies to armies even if their list allows camels but where they have not been included in the army.","2. In a doubles game where armies are fighting as allies, if one army has camels and the other does not, camels will also unsettle allied cavalry or chariot units within 20cm as described above."]},"Chariot Runners":{"text":["Chariot runners arc infantry units that accompany chariots either on-foot or by hitching a ride and dismounting once combat begins.","","1. If a chariot runner unit is touching a friendly chariot unit and both are included in a brigade order, the chariot runners unit\'s movement is increased to that of the chariot unit. Each chariot unit can \'carry\' one chariot runner unit in this way. The chariot runners and chariots **must** end the move touching&mdash;even if one or the other charges during the move."]},"Elephants":{"text":["Elephants are awesome but somewhat unpredictable weapons of ancient warfare&mdash;often proving as deadly to their own side as to the enemy. Once out of control they are inclined to panic and stampede, carrying their hapless crews through their own lines.","","1. Elephants are terrifying and their enemies therefore suffer the usual -1 Combat modifier.","","2. Elephants receive the additional + 1 charge bonus Combat rnodifier when charging enemies in the open.","","3. Elephants that are driven back by shooting, or retreating from combat, or moving as a result of a blunder, will automatically rampage through each unit they contact during the drive back/retreat/blundered move. They will rampage through units regardless of whether they are friends or foes. This includes units they are already touching as well as units they touch as they move. Elephants will rampage through friends even if these make way and will rampage through enerny or friends even where the Elephant is destroyed as a result of retreating into enemy or into another combat.<p>Each unit that is rampaged through must test for confusion and becomes confused on the D6 roll of a 6. If a unit is already confused and is rampaged through then it is still necessary to test, if the dice result is a 6, the unit is destroyed entirely. All stands are removed when this happens during combats, this does not count as additional hits and combat results remain unaffected. See Confusion p63.</p><p>A unit that makes way for Elephants that are retreating from combat will have to test twice for confusion&mdash;once for Elephants and once for making way. In this instance, and all instances where multiple tests are required, always test for Elephants last of all.</p>","","If an army list has elephant units of three stands then these can instead be fielded as three separate units of one stand each&mdash;this is entirely up to the player but must be established before the game begins. If an army includes more than one unit of elephants then all must be fielded in the same way&mdash;either as individuals or as units of three. If a unit is divided then each stand subsequently counts as an individual unit in all respects. The Victory points value of each elephant stand is 1/3 that given for the full unit of three rounded up to the nearest five (70 pts for standard Indian and 50 pts for standard African elephant). The army\'s withdrawal point must be increased concomitantly, counting each elephant stand as a unit.","","The following rules apply to all elephant units of one stand. This includes units of three stands that have been divided into separate units and units of three stands reduced in size to one stand due to casualties.","","Elephants can be included as part of a brigade order without adding to the size of the brigade if there is at least one infantry unit in the brigade for each elephant, and, there are no chariots, cavalry or camels in the brigade. For example, a brigade could consist of four elephants and four infantry units and would count as four units. Three elephants and two infantry would count as three units&mdash;two infantry with two elephants counting as two plus an extra elephant. One elephant, one infantry, and one cavalry counts as three units because the brigade includes cavalry and therefore the elephant can\'t be included for \'free\'.","","Up to four individual elephants can also be given a brigade order if they form a \'screen\' of elephant stands separated by gaps of no more than 4cm between each elephant. Gaps between elephants must be clear gaps without any intervening troops or terrain that the elephants could not cross. Elephant screen brigades cannot include other types of troops. Although referred to as a \'screen\', this is also a useful way of grouping elephants that have become dispersed following combat.","","Individual elephant stands do not receive the +1 charge bonus for \'Elephant charging against enemy in the open\'. Henceforth, this bonus only applies to undivided units of at least two elephants and represents the mass charge of a large number of beasts. Note that the bonus does not apply where two or more separate elephants happen to be positioned next to each other (if you want the bonus use big elephant herds and deploy them as whole units). This does mean that a unit of three elephants reduced to a single elephant foregoes the charge bonus (and having lost all his friends you can\'t blame him, can you!).","","Elephants brigaded with Warband infantry do not affect the Warband\'s command bonus so long as there is at least one infantry unit for each elephant in the brigade.","","Note that as per the regular rules, elephant units of three stands that have been reduced to a single model still have an associated Command penalty of -2 (-1 per stand lost). This only applies to multi-stand units&mdash;it does not apply to elephants that have been divided into separate units of one stand."]},"Encampment":{"text":["Some armies can include an encampment on the battlefield, principally migrating barbarian tribes, such as the Goths at Adrianople. This takes the form of a wagon laager&mdash;a rough circle or square of wagons and temporary defences such as plashing, stakes, etc.",""," The encampment is considered to be terrain. Essentially it is treated as an area of ground much as a wood or village. To represent the encampment you will need some method of marking a square base area 16cm x 16cm. A single large card base is the most obvious way, but separate smaller bases may be more convenient, or you could simply mark out the area by placing model wagons around the periphery. Either way, position suitable wagon models within the area to denote the encampment. It is helpful, although not essential, if wagon models can be removed to allow stands to move within the area in the same way as for model trees or buildings.",""," The encampment is treated as a village/built up area except that the whole area is also deemed to be \'road or track\'. This means that cavalry in column formation can move inside or traverse the encampment, but they do not benefit from defended status whilst inside. Cavalry units charging an enemy inside an encampment still form a battleline, but must be in column formation at the start of their move in order to enter. Note that the enemy will count as defended and no charge bonuses will therefore apply. See p32 and p33 of the *Warmaster Ancients* rulebook for rules governing village/built up areas and roads and tracks.",""," An encampment costs points (usually 50 points) and is considered to be a \'troop unit\' for purposes of calculating withdraw numbers and working out which side wins.

In most cases, such formations were ad hoc affairs that can be represented perfectly well by placing cavalry and infantry units next to each other. In a few particular cases, the new Special Rule \'Hamippoi\' applies, allowing infantry and cavalry units to function in a co-ordinated way that emphasises this tactic. Examples of infantry that fought in this manner include Spanish skirmishers, and the Greek Hamippoi whose title gives us the name of the rule. Hamippoi is Greek for \'With Horse\' and no more than a descriptive title of infantry skirmishers who have been placed \'with horse\' to fight alongside them.","","1. If a Hamippoi unit is touching a friendly cavalry unit and both are included in a brigade order, the Hamippoi\'s movement is increased to that of the cavalry unit. A cavalry unit can \'carry\' only one Hamippoi unit in this way.

Infantry are normally forbidden from pursing cavalry and chariots, but in the case of Hamippoi, they can do so as part of a pursuit involving cavalry.","3. If Hamippoi infantry are positioned so that they touch a friendly unit of cavalry that is engaged in combat, then they are considered to be part of the same combat engagement even where they are not touching any enemy. Specifically this means they are included when calculating retreat distances, will fall back if required, can stand, pursue and advance if victorious, and must retreat if defeated. If unable to pursue into contact with retreating enemy, they can still pursue so long as they can move into touch with pursuing friendly cavalry.","","The Hamippoi rule adds +10 to the cost of a standard infantry skirmish unit.","","Note that there is no obligation for Hamippoi infantry units to remain in touch with cavalry units throughout the game. However, they will need to be touching to exploit their special abilities as described above."]},"Legion":{"text":["Roman legions of the early Imperial period are judged to be exceptionally well drilled to a degree beyond that of other troops. This internal cohesion and acute discipline is reflected by the Legion rule.","","1. In the first round of a combat engagement, Legion stands that are fighting an enemy to their front edge or front corner count as supported in combat. This bonus is lost if a stand has enemy touching its side edge, rear edge or rear corner. This means a fighting stand will normally have a + 1 support bonus in the first round of a combat, even where it is not supported by other stands: in effect the stand supports itself. This is cumulative with other support bonuses from other stands as usual."]},"Light Artillery":{"text":["Light artillery describes fully portable artillery pieces such as a Roman scorpion. These are mostly bolt throwing machines in type but might also include small ballistae throwing a stone or cast shot. These weapons are effective both ar piercing armour and penetrating deep formations and have a longer range than ordinary shooting.","","1. A unit taking a hit from a light artillery piece is disallowed any Armour roll it normally has. Armour is of no value against light artillery.","2. A light artillery stand can shoot in the zone directly forward of its front edge&mdash;see p37.","3. A light artillery shot can strike up to three touching stands within the missile\'s line of sight as shown on the diagram on p125. These can be stands from the same or different units&mdash;the only consideration is that the stands are touching so the shot passes over an unbroken area of bases.","","Roll one dice against each unit for each stand that lies beneath the missile\'s flight. The missile automatically follows the shortest route between the artillery stand and the closest target. For example, if a unit is in a column and three stands lie beneath the missile\'s flight, roll three dice. If two units are in line one behind the other, roll one dice against each unit.","","Because it is possible to shoot at one enemy unit and inflict hits on a unit next to it, it can sometimes happen that units engaged in combat suffer one or more hits from artillery. An engaged friendly unit call also suffer hits if a player is careless enough to place his units in the line of fire. Any engaged units taking hits from light artillery first remove casualties and then carry remaining hits forward into the following combat round. All such hits count as struck in the following round for purposes of working out the combat result. Note that no drive backs apply to units engaged in combat."]},"Maniple":{"text":["Where two maniple units are engaged in close combat one behind the other, the total number of hits suffered by the unit in front is potentially reduced. This works as follows. Work out the total number of hits inflicted on the unit and take any Armour rolls as usual. Then roll one dice for each stand that is supporting the unit from the rear. For each dice roll of a 6, reduce the number of hits suffered by 1. Thus the maniple \'save\' works just like an extra Armour roll taken after the normal Armour roll. Remember that this only applies to stands supporting from behind (not from the side) and it only applies when one maniple unit is supporting another."]},"Phalanx":{"text":["A phalanx is a deep formation made up of warriors armed with long pikes or spears. We use the term exclusively for those armed with pikes&mdash;the main fighting infantry type of Macedonian and later Hellenistic armies. Pikes could be extremely long so that a closely packed phalanx presents an almost unstoppable hedge of spear points to its front. Conversely, a phalanx is easily disordered if attcked to its flanks or moving over dense terrain.","","1. To preserve the aesthetic appearance of the phalanx and reflect the characteristics of yhe troop type, phalangites are mounted facing the short (20mm) edge of the base. See Appendix 2 for alternative basing suggestions for larger scale models.","2. The phalanx is a cumbersome and relatively inflexible formation. To represent this, a phalanx unit moves at normal infantry pace of 20cm in the Command phase if it is both in a line formation and if the unit moves either directly forward or charges. In all other situations or formations, including during evades, the phalanx moves at half pace in the Command phase (10cm).","3. None-measured and fixed moves that take place outside the Command phase&mdash;such as advances, drive backs, pursuits, and fall backs are worked our exactly like other troops.","4. Phalanx stands can not be supported from behind&mdash;their basing already represents the depth of the phalanx formation. Phalanx stands can be supported by other phalanx stands to their side, or by other infantry stands positioned to their side and congruent to their front. See Support p49.","5. A Phalanx stand striking to its side or rear has an Attack value of \'0\'. Units are still entitled to a \'Last Ditch\' dice where they would not otherwise strike at all.","6.

They are likely to be armed with long spears or lances, and charge at a good pace to deliver a decisive blow or punch through the enemy lines. These units are indicated in the army lists.","","1. Shock cavalry units can be based facing the short (20mm) edge of the stand. Their narrow frontage and increased depth can be thought of as representing successive co-ordinated waves of attack against a narrow point.","2. Alternatively to the above, shock cavalry can be based facing the long (40mm) edge of the stand in which case, each stand adds + 1 Combat Attack when charging or pursuing.","3. If shock cavalry units are armed with bows, their shooting zone is always straight ahead of their frontage. See Shooting Zone p37.","","**Note:** Two base sizes are given because it is recognised that players using larger scale models will find it impractical to base stands to the short edge. In addition, some players may have pre-existing armies based to a 40mm frontage. The long edge basing is not an exact equivalent, but it is comparable overall and is presented as a reasonable compromise. See the Appendices for more on alternative basing for different units."]},"Skirmish":{"text":["In the Warmaster Ancients game, most skirmishers represent troops whose role is exclusively skirmishing. Whilst other troops may skirmish to a degree, they do so on the tactical level subsumed within close combat. The exceptions are some light cavalry and chariot units which are adjudged to have a duel role and which usually carry a mixture of weapons, eg, Huns.","","Because skirmishers are such a fundamental part of the armies, the skirmish rules are described throughout the book in the appropriate sections. These are summarised below together with references to the full descriptions.","","Skirmishers carry suitable weapons&mdash;sometimes bows but more likely s lings or javelins&mdash;and fight in loose, informal formations taking advantage of local terrain to avoid contact with more powerful but less mobile enemies. In general, skirmishing units represent fewer men than close fighting units. It is assumed they will usually disperse or flee if attacked.","","1. Skirmishers always move at up to full pace for their type regardless of format ion or circumstances (see p22).","2. Skirmishing units can see all round&mdash;they can draw a line of sight from any stand\'s edge. Their shooting zone extends all round to their front, side and rear. Because they can see enemies to their side or rear they can charge, evade or otherwise react to such units (see p10 Visibility) and (p37 Shooting).","3. Unless confused, skirmishers are allowed to evade from an enemy charge in the opposing Command phase (see p24).","4. Unless confused, skirmishers arc allowed to evade instead of being driven back by shooting in the opposing Shooting phase (see p25).","5. Skirmishers can evade through other units. If these other units are not skirmishers, or if they are a second or subsequent unit evaded through regardless of whether they are skirmishers or not, then both units must test for confusion once the move is complete. Units become confused on the roll of a 6 (see p24).","6. Skirmishing infantry can support from the side only: they cannot support from behind (see p50).","7. Skirmishing infantry can move through some types of terrain that is otherwise impassable&mdash;notably rivers/deep water, forests, and cliffs. This is described in the section on Terrain &amp; Movement (see p31).","","**Note:** For the avoidance of doubt, skirmishing infantry are able to evade from charging cavalry, or other non-skirmishing units, even if these units have a greater move distance than they do. In this case, skirmishers are assumed to have already seen, reacted to, and taken steps to avoid their attackers well before they reach their position."]},"Slow":{"text":["The \'Slow\' special rule applies to units that are exceptionally heavily armoured or encumbered for their basic type. In our game, they do not move at a slower rate than other units of the same type, but they are less likely to move repeatedly.

As such they were always retained until really needed and not generally used in the early, indecisive stages of a battle.","","1. To reflect their role, a unit of Triari counts as two units when it is destroyed. Note that a unit of Triari still counts as one unit when calculating the initial withdrawal level at the start of the game. This means that a Roman Republican army that would normally withdraw when five ordinary units are destroyed. will also withdraw if three ordinary units and one unit of Trirai arc destroyed."]},"Unreliable":{"text":["Unreliable units represent troops that, for whatever reason, have little enthusiasm for the job in hand or uncertain or wavering loyalty.

They cannot be brigaded with other troops, although several Giants can be brigaded together if you so wish. If you attempt to give an order to a Giant and fail then you must take a test to see what it does. Ignore potential blunders - these are taken into account by the following rules. Roll a dice and consult the Giant Goes Wild chart. Where Giants are brigaded together roll for each separately.","","Giants have a great many hits, 8 in fact, which are almost impossible to inflict during even a fairly lengthy combat engagement. Because Giants have so many hits we must consider the possibility of hurting the Giant and reducing its effectiveness in subsequent turns. Therefore, if a Giant has accumulated 4-7 hits by the end of the Shooting phase or Combat phase it is deemed to have been badly hurt. Once a Giant is badly hurt all accumulated hits are discounted and its maximum Hits value and Attacks are halved for the rest of the battle (to 4 Hits and 4 Attacks). A Giant causes terror in its enemies.","","__Giant Goes Wild Chart__","","|||","-|-","_D6_|_On no!

If he reaches an enemy unit he will attack as normal. If he reaches a friendly unit he will walk straight through and out the other side if there is room and he has sufficient move. If he reaches a friendly unit and does not have sufficient move or enough room to walk all the way through then he halts on contact. A friendly unit that is walked through or contacted in this way instantly becomes confused for the remainder of the Command phase. Such a unit ceases to be confused at the end of the Command phase along with other confused units.","5|The Giant moves towards the nearest enemy unit that he can see as fast as he can.

Your average Dwarf likes to keep both feet firmly planted on the ground or, preferably, below it. However, the Dwarf Engineers Guild numbers amongst its select membership some of the most eccentric and foolhardy of Dwarf kind. These are individuals whose obsessions verge on, and quite clearly beyond, the insane. Only the most determined and talented members of the Guild know the secrets of heavier-than-air flying machines. This curious and occasionally devastating machine represents the pinnacle of the Dwarf Engineer’s art.","","The Gyrocopter is a flying machine, so all the usual flying rules apply (see Flying Units p.59-61). The model always forms a single unit on its own, must be given orders individually, cannot be brigaded with other units and cannot be joined by a character in combat.","","The Gyrocopter is armed with a small, short range, crank-driven, piston activated gun which is powered by the motion of the rotor shaft. The engine is fuelled by alcohol (as is the pilot!). ","","The Gyrocopter’s fast-firing gun is light in weight and fires a small calibre shot.

A Steam Tank therefore shoots to its front, side or rear against the closest enemy target. Targets suffering hits from a Steam Tank count their Armour value as one worse than normal - so 3+ counts as 4+, 4+ as 5+, whilst 6+ is ignored. A Steam Tank can shoot at charging enemy.","","Because of its exceptionally heavy armour plating, a Steam Tank always counts as defended - so a 5 or 6 is normally required to inflict a hit from shooting or in combat. The Steam Tank fights combat like any other unit, except that if it retreats it is automatically destroyed in the same way as artillery (it is overwhelmed and hence abandoned by its crew).","","Steam Tanks cannot be driven back or routed by shooting. However - it is still deemed necessary to roll drive backs to determine if the Steam Tank becomes Confused on a roll of a 6.","","If the player attempts to issue an order to a Steam Tank and rolls double six then the order is failed as usual and the machine does not move.

In these cases the Rod of Repetition can be used instead of the random dice roll to try and cast the second spell if you prefer, or the Rod of Repetition could be used after the second spell has been cast assuming it is cast successfully.
